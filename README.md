# Two-Wheel Drive Robot Simulation on ROS1

A ROS-based project featuring a two-wheel differential drive robot simulation, designed for kinematics testing, path planning, and control systems practice.

## Features

- **Two-Wheel Differential Drive System**: Developed and implemented a differential drive system using ROS Noetic for accurate movement and control.
- **Simulation in Gazebo and RViz**: Created and visualized simulations of the two-wheel drive robot, enabling thorough functionality testing.
- **URDF Model**: Built a Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) model to represent the robot in the ROS environment, allowing realistic simulation and testing.
- **Path Planning and Goal Setting**: Enhanced understanding of ROS control frameworks, differential kinematics, and pathfinding through maze-solving applications.

## Technologies Used

- **ROS Noetic**: Provides the robotics framework for controlling and simulating the robot.
- **Gazebo and RViz**: Simulation tools for visualizing and testing the robotâ€™s movement and control capabilities.
- **URDF Modeling**: Enables accurate representation and testing of robot functionality in a simulated environment.

This project provides a comprehensive foundation in ROS control systems and differential drive robotics, with applications in simulation, path planning, and robotics.
